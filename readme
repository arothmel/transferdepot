# transferdepot

WIP scratchpad — not production ready

## Current layout
- `app.py` – Flask entrypoint, sets up blueprints and config
- `services/files.py` – file save/load helpers, groups.json handling
- `templates/` – index + upload form
- `uwsgi.ini` – uwsgi config (long uploads + workers)

## Notes
- groups.json currently lives outside project (`transferdepot-001/config/groups.json`)
- env vars: `TD_UPLOAD_FOLDER`, `TD_GROUPS_FILE`, `TD_CHUNK_SIZE`
- goal: **don’t freeze the system during uploads**
- testing with uWSGI → 2 processes, 2 threads

## Next
- hook up `/files/<group>/<filename>` serving
- admin UI for groups (add/rename)
- more perf tests on upload streaming
